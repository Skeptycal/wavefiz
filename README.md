## Wavefunction Visualizer

This repository implements the wavefunction visualizer seen at [ridiculousfish.com/wavefiz](http://ridiculousfish.com/wavefiz/).

It is MIT licensed. The code is mostly TypeScript and an effort has been made to ensure it is clean and readable.

## Building

You'll need TypeScript and uglify-js:

    npm install -g typescript
	npm install -g uglify-js

Now just:

    make

If all goes well, open `staged/index.html` to see it in action.

Contributions for a more modern build system are welcome.
